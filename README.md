Used code snippets from Bootstrap to develop these pages. 

I'm still working on putting the Navbar on the left hand side for the Admin page as planned in the wireframe. For now it is on the top and the top performers are on the left instead.

Here are the wireframes I created before starting:

Admin Wireframe:
